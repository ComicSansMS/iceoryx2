Hi Rustaceans,

We are pleased to announce our second release of iceoryx2, version 0.2.1.
This inter-process zero-copy framework, crafted entirely in Rust, equips you
with tools for efficient communication between multiple processes. iceoryx2
facilitates event transmission across process boundaries, and allows
you to send large messages with minimal and consistent latency, regardless
of the message size.

**Release Highlights:**

1. **Mac OS Support:**
   - iceoryx2 now supports Mac OS in addition to Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD,
     providing cross-platform consistency.

2. **Expanded Service Support:**
   - Introduces support services with the same name but different messaging
     patterns, allowing for greater customization.

3. **Lower Rust Version Requirement:**
   - Reduced the required Rust version to 1.70.0, making iceoryx2 compatible
     with a wider range of Rust versions.

4. **Bug Fixes & Improved Interfaces:**
   - Various bug fixes and enhanced interfaces for built-in containers,
     facilitating more efficient zero-copy communication.

Thank you for your continued support!

Exciting news! I've just unleashed a brand-new zero-copy inter-process
middleware called iceoryx2, and it's crafted entirely in Rust. The GitHub
repository is live here: https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2, so if
you're looking for a cutting-edge open source Rust middleware, whether it's
for apps, robots, or even spacecraft voyaging to the moon, probes plumbing
the ocean's depths, or connecting AI algorithms with sources handling
massive data throughput or financial brokerage, I'd love for you to check
it out and get your feedback.
