> Every payload you transmit with iceoryx2 must be compatible with shared

>
> * be self contained, no heap, no pointers to external sources
> * have a uniform memory representation -> `#[repr(C)]`
> * not use pointers to manage their internal structure
> * the type and its members don't implement `Drop` explicitly
>
> Data types like `String` or `Vec` will cause undefined behavior and may
> result in segmentation faults. We provide alternative data types that are
